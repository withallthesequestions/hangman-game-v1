# hangman-game-v1

= To do list =

* remove the commas from the string
* do not include the space or question mark characters (as those don't tend to get used in hangman) 
* The keyboard buttons are optional, but would be a nice touch
* Have a more dramatic victory condition
* Perhaps images?
* Scoreboard?
* Timer/countdown?
